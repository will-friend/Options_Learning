# Options_Learning
Notebooks performing different calculations or code dives, regarding financial options contracts. 
\item The first notebook *Monte_Carlo_for_Options.ipynb* walks through the Black-Scholes model and how to simulate an options price based on forecasting the underlying assets change in price between some time *t* and the maturation date of the call contract *T*.
\item The second notebook *Option_Hedging.ipynb* mimics the [PyQuant article](https://www.pyquantnews.com/the-pyquant-newsletter/establish-simple-delta-hedge-actually-works-python) explores the QuantLib library and its application in modeling options, calculating the $\Delta$ of an option, and how to implment a hedging strategy.
